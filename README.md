### Hi there ðŸ‘‹!

I am Tanmay and I go by the pronoun 'he'.

I am currently working on two flutter apps and a physics simulation engine.

One of the apps is a task manager app and the other is a social media app whose audience are intended to be programmers.

The engine is currently being designed to simulate basic stuff. Also I am only designing it for 2D physics as of now. I do have plans to increase the number of dimensions. However that would most likely be a sub project within the project.

You can follow the progress of all these projects on my github.

You can reach me at: tanmay.d.choudhary@gmail.com

Have a nice day ðŸŒ»ðŸ˜„!
